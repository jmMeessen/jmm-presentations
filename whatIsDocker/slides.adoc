== And you ? ==

[%step]
* Developers ?
* Ops ?
* Security ?
* Managers ?

Actually things aren't that bad

== You and Docker ? ==

[%step]
* Never heard about it ?
* Some "Proof of Concept" ?
* Use it every day ?
* In Production ?

== Today's talk

* What are "containers" ?
* How to start ?
* Where is Docker heading ?

Docker Container is an analogy to the revolution in the Shipping industry brought by the container.

== Docker Containers are :

* Isolated namespace (process, users, network, cgroups, etc)
* Lightweight "virtualized servers"
* A new artifact paradigm

== !

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Draw the attention on the Docker process.
- Containers are old, LXC (OpenVZ) been around for some time.
- Container load fast
--

== Applications packaged with system dependencies

* one application works on Ubuntu with Python 2
* second application works on Centos 7.2 with Python 3

== Execution mode

** Container can run and then exit
** Container can in background (daemon)

== Demo


== What Docker solves

[%step]
* Escape the dependencies hell
* Fast iterative Infrastructure improvement
* Container "loader" & Container "shipper"
** (no more "it worked in Dev, now it's OPS problem")
* easy onboarding of Devs.
* "Own test environment"

pass:[<p style="font-size:400%; font-family: 'League Gothic', Impact, sans-serif;">How to start ?</p>]

== Need a container enabled "Kernel"

== Linux or Windows 10 (beta)

== Install the Docker "daemon"

== Docker client

* Run, stop, halt container
* Remove stopped container
* Examine logs
* etc.

== And for Windows or Mac OS X ?

[%step]
* Install a virtual machine (ex VirtualBox)
* Ready made bundles:
** Docker Toolbox
** New, better integrated, clients
* Using (corporate) proxies: advanced topic

== Then you need images

[%step]
* Note: an image is immutable
* you get them from
** DockerHub
** Corporate Registry
* Or build it yourself

== Building a Docker Image

* Described in a Dockerfile

== Describe a complete Infrastructure

* Complex systems
** Fuse ESB server
** MQ series servers
** Oracle database
* Use "docker-compose"

== docker-compose

* one place to define
** your components
** how to (docker) build them
** what container should start first
** networks (who can talk to whom)
** (data) volumes
** Security restrictions
** Etc.

== "Build, Ship and Run"

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Build: easier to build application
- Ship: easier/faster to package and deploy apps
- Run: easier for microservices/cloud/orchestration

== Docker Inc.

[%step]
* Docker has been surprised by this techno "flare"
* Very, very lively Open Source community
* "Batteries included"
* Standardization (RunC, etc.)

== Well grounded approach

* Coming from the hosting world

image::images/docker_unusable_scy.jpg[width=80%]

== Status

* Was good for development and integration
* Start to be usable for Real Life Run
** Since December 2015

== Status

* Start to offer enterprise level solutions
** "Docker Datacenter"
*** Trusted Registry (Image scanning, sig/auth)
*** Docker Universal Control Plane
** Docker Cloud
