== Docker containers

A novel way to manipulate applications and their dependencies.

== Containers are :

* Isolated namespace (process, users, network, cgroups, etc)
* Lightweight "virtualized servers"
* A new artifact paradigm

Draw the attention on the Docker process.
Containers are old, LXC (OpenVZ) been around for some time.
--

== Container load fast

== Package application with dependencies

* one application works on Ubuntu with Python 2
* second application works on Centos 7 with Python 3

== !

** Container can run and then exit
** Container can in background (daemon)

== Demo


== What Docker solves

* Escape the dependencies hell
** isolates from conflicting libraries
* fast iterative Infrastructure improvement
* Container loader & Container shipper
** (no more "it worked in Dev, now it's OPS problem")
* easy onboarding of Devs.
