# Jmm's presentations

This is the repository where I share the presentation that I have been doing.

## Technical details

I mainly work with asciidoctor and reveal.js backend. To start a new presentation,

* create a new directory
* copy the reveal.js directory (TODO: where is it comming from)
* copy the build_slides.sh and make it executable
* copy the document template (TODO: create such a template)

Notes about the reveal.js backend can be found at https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/
